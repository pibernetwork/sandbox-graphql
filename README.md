# Sandbox 2

Sandbox to test oportunities on improve GraphqQL development

## Intention

Learn Graphql Generation Code

## Fundations

The GraphqQL is a great tool. Working in plain tools seems very verbose and repetitive. There is a lot of places where you can lost the track of changes. Unit test only provided a layer of verification but it hides the true problem of duplication and manual coding.

The idea behind sandbox-2 is to enable a more powerful way of working with GraphQL. We should rely on more automation.

## Expecations

Make GraphQL development easier, fast and cleaner.

## Features

To proof of concept we're gonna to use the idea of a Profile with Personal User Informations.

## Limits

This project should be used only for proof of concept. New tests of automation tools should be done in this repository.
